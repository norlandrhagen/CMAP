Gallery
-------

This gallery contains a selection of examples of the plots Altair can create.

Some may seem fairly complicated at first glance, but they are built by combining a simple set of declarative building blocks.

Many draw upon sample datasets compiled by the `Vega <https://vega.github.io/vega/>`_ project. To access them yourself, install `vega_datasets <https://github.com/altair-viz/vega_datasets>`_.

.. code-block:: none

   $ pip install vega_datasets
